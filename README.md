# FFTBench
Compares different FFT implementations for .Net programs.

Thanks to Christian Woltering and his arcticle "Comparison of FFT Implementations for .NET" [https://www.codeproject.com/articles/1095473/comparison-of-fft-implementations-for-net] which is the base for this project.

Further thanks to PeterPet and his FFTS project [https://github.com/PetterPet01/FFTSSharp] which is also part of this project.

The following FFT implementations can be compared:
-	Accord
-	AForge
-	DSPLib
-	Exocortex
-	Math.NET
-	NAudio
-	Lomont
-	FFTW
-	FFTS
-	MKL (by Intel)

## Usage
Open the solution, compile and start the FFTBench project.
